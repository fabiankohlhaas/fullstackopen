## Description

This is what i did when i followed along the mdn tutorials for [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics) and [HTML Forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Your_first_HTML_form). This is not my code, it is just the result of following allong with the tutorials. The exercises do not need to be commited. I just wanted everything I did in the course in one place, that is why I included this in the repository.
